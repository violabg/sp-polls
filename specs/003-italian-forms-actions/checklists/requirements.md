- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Validation Summary

**Total Items**: 16  
**Passed**: 16  
**Failed**: 0  
**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

### Key Strengths

1. Four distinct, independently testable user stories with clear priorities
2. Comprehensive functional requirements (12 FRs) covering all aspects of the feature
3. Measurable success criteria with specific metrics (timing, percentages, coverage)
4. Well-defined edge cases showing consideration of potential issues
5. Proper assumptions documented for clarity
6. Clear distinction between P1 (core) and P2 (enhancement) priorities
